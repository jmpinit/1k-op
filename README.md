# 1K-OP

A little programmable computer-toy for your pocket. I hope that it contains a little bit of the deep joy and obsession that I have for computers. 

The hardware provides a little display and speaker for output, and 8 buttons for input. 

The software provides a (very) minimal Forth-like programming environment. 

**Inspirations:**

* Teenage Engineering OP-1 
* John Earnest's Mako virtual game console 
* TI-83+-induced carpal tunnel, and buttons worn illegible
