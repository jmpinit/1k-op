# 1K-OP

It wants to be a little device that you pull out of your pocket to write little audio-visual demos with. A toy and a talisman, I want to embody in it a little bit of the deep joy and obsession that draws me to computers. 

The hardware provides a little display and speaker for output, and 8 buttons for input. 

The software provides a (very) minimal Forth-like programming environment. 

**Inspirations:**

* Teenage Engineering OP-1 
* John Earnest's Mako virtual game console 
* TI-83+-induced carpal tunnel, and buttons worn illegible
